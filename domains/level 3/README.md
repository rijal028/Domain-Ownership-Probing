# Level 3 Domains (Advanced / Research)

This folder is intended for **Level 3 probe texts**: advanced, specialized, research-level probes.

Goal:
- test high-level domain competence representation
- measure sharpness of separation at advanced abstraction levels

Notes:
- probes may overlap more naturally across fields
- ownership may drop for weaker / smaller models
- results are sensitive to probe quality
